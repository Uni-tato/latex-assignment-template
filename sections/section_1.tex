\section{Bananas} \label{s:1}

It's a little known fact, but a grouping of more than one banana isn't actually called a "bunch" of bananas. Rather, a single banana is referred to as a "finger", and group of finger bananas is called a "hand". A group of more than one hand is called a "bunch". Refer to Figure \ref{img:bananas} for an illustration.
